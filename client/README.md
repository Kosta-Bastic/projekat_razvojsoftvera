# Client Application

This directory is prepared for the client-side application.

## Setup Instructions

1. Add your client application files to this directory
2. Update the root `.gitignore` if needed to exclude client build artifacts
3. Add any necessary build configuration (package.json, angular.json, etc.)

## Typical Structure

```
client/
├── src/
├── public/
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

Replace this README with your client application's documentation.
